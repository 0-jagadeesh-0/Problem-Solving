Given two lists of integers a and b, as well as an integer k, return the number of elements in a that are strictly smaller than at least k elements in b.

**Constraints**

- n ≤ 50,000 where n is the length of a.
- m ≤ 50,000 where m is the length of b.
- 0 ≤ k ≤ m


**Example 1**
**Input**
```
   a = [5, -3, 99, 10]
   b = [32, 5, 29, 7, 13]
   k = 3
```
**Output**
```
3
