Given a binary tree root, return the maximum average value of a subtree. A subtree is defined to be some node in root including all of its descendants. A subtree average is the sum of the node values divided by the number of nodes.

**Constraints**

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in root
